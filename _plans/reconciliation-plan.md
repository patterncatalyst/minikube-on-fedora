title: Reconciliation plan
description: What in this tutorial is verified, what is in flight, and what still needs validation.
---

This document tracks the **gap between what the tutorial claims and
what has been verified end-to-end** on real hardware. It is the
single authoritative list of things to check, fix, or expand
before the tutorial is declared production-ready.

## How to use this document

- When adding new tutorial content that makes a verifiable claim,
  add a row to the appropriate section below as `unverified`
- When you (or a contributor) actually test a claim on the real
  target platform, promote the row to `verified (Fedora 44)`,
  noting which platform was tested
- When something is being actively debugged, mark it `in flight`
  with a brief note about what's blocking
- When you decide not to test something in this iteration, mark it
  `out of scope` with the reason

**Default state for new claims is `unverified`.** Promotion to
`verified` requires a real test run by a human, with the result
recorded.

## Conventions

- A `verified` row has been run end-to-end on at least one named
  platform with the exact commands shown in the tutorial
- `verified (Fedora 44)` is the canonical primary-platform marker
  for this project; macOS is acknowledged as advisory only and
  rows aren't expected to carry a macOS verification
- An `in flight` row is being actively worked on; the assigned
  contributor is named where known
- An `unverified` row is a claim that has not been re-validated
  against a current environment
- An `out of scope` row is something deliberately not verified in
  this iteration; the reason is given

## A. Pinned tool versions

The versions this tutorial is written against. Every claim later
in the document implicitly assumes these.

## B. Per-section claims

Claims made in prose that are not yet end-to-end verified. New
rows added as sections get drafted; rows are promoted to
`verified` when their underlying claim has been exercised on
Fedora 44.

| Status                  | Claim                                                                       | Section | Notes                                                                       |

## C. Testing matrix

End-to-end tests of each runnable example. This is where the
reconciliation plan earns its keep — a reviewer should see at a
glance which examples are confirmed to actually work, and which
are still aspirational.

| Status     | Example                              | Section | Notes                                                 |
|------------|--------------------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **verified (Fedora 44)** | `examples/03-driver-check/`        | §3      | r05c user run: cluster up, all 8 kube-system pods Running, ✓ SUCCESS |
| **in flight** | `examples/06-deploy-nginx-kubectl`   | §6      | Shipped in r07; awaiting user run on Fedora 44                          |
| unverified | `examples/07-nodeport-service`       | §7      | Expose Deployment via NodePort, retrieve URL          |
| unverified | `examples/08-persistent-volume`      | §8      | `hostPath` PV + dynamic PVC                           |
| unverified | `examples/09-deploy-nginx-helm`      | §9      | Same UBI nginx via an authored small helm chart       |
| unverified | `examples/11-istio-bookinfo`         | §11     | Istio sample app with sidecar + Gateway + VS          |
| unverified | `examples/12-keda-http-scale`        | §12     | KEDA HTTP add-on + `hey` load test                    |

**Aggregator status:** `scripts/test-all-examples.sh` does not
yet exist; will be added once the first two examples' `demo.sh`
pass on their own.

## D. Iteration log and open priorities

Iteration-by-iteration record of what landed, what was promoted,
and what's next.

**Done:**

- ✅ **r01** (2026-05-16) — PRD drafted and approved
- ✅ **r02** (2026-05-16) — Skeleton scaffolded with project
  branding; GitHub Pages site live at
  `https://patterncatalyst.github.io/minikube-on-fedora/`
- ✅ **r03** (2026-05-17) — `_docs/01-prerequisites.md` drafted;
  iteration plan codified; `CONTRIBUTING.md` added;
  `scripts/audit-fedora-prereqs.sh` shipped. User audit + UBI
  test confirmed Fedora 44, Podman 5.8.2 rootless, UBI pullable
  without subscription. Four reconciliation rows promoted
- ✅ **r04** (2026-05-17) — `_docs/02-installation.md` drafted
  with pinned install paths: minikube via dnf-from-upstream-RPM,
  kubectl skipped or upstream binary, helm 4.1.x via
  `dnf install helm`, httpie via dnf, mikefarah yq via upstream
  binary (corrected in r05 — see below), krew installer +
  `stern`/`ctx`/`ns` via krew, hey via `go install`.
  Audit script bugs fixed (podman 5.x `CgroupVersion` template,
  `maybe()` stderr leak)
- ✅ **r05** (2026-05-17) — `_docs/03-starting-minikube.md`
  drafted (cluster start, layers, status, lifecycle, drivers,
  in-cluster runtime). `examples/03-driver-check/` added —
  project's first runnable demo. **r04 follow-up fix in §2**:
  yq is packaged in Fedora 44 as mikefarah's yq (4.47.1), so
  §2's install instruction is now `sudo dnf install -y yq`.
  Three sub-iterations (r05a/b/c) resolved before demo green:
  - r05a: added `jekyll-seo-tag` to Gemfile (skeleton bug
    breaking every Pages build since r02)
  - r05b: added `--rootless` flag — rootful default failed with
    `sudo: a password is required`; fixed audit script's krew
    plugin detection
  - r05c: added `--container-runtime=containerd` and orphaned-
    podman-volume cleanup — rootless+docker-runtime failed on
    `docker.service` start inside the cluster container
  Final r05c demo run: cluster up on containerd 2.2.1, kindnet
  CNI, all 8 kube-system pods Running, ✓ SUCCESS

- ✅ **r06** (2026-05-17) — `_docs/04-profiles-multi-node.md` +
  `_docs/05-addons-dashboard.md` (small sections combined per
  the plan). §3 polish: expected-output block aligned with
  r05c user run; harmless kic-artifacts callout added.
  Iteration plan refreshed (Phase 1 + 2 marked ✅; `sleep 5`
  baked into verification rhythm; sub-iteration calibration
  recorded). Section C `examples/03-driver-check/` promoted to
  `verified (Fedora 44)` — first row out of `in flight`. User
  verification recipe (profile lifecycle + three-addon enable
  flow) passed cleanly: scratch profile up/listed/deleted with
  per-cluster resource override observed; metrics-server +
  ingress + dashboard all enabled with expected pod state and
  dashboard URL returned

**Phase 2 done** (2026-05-17).

**In flight:**

- **r07** — §6 first real workload-deployment iteration.
  `_docs/06-deploying-with-kubectl.md` drafted (25-min section
  on Pods/ReplicaSets/Deployments mental model, manifest
  walkthrough, apply/inspect/expose/port-forward/scale/rolling-
  update sequence). `examples/06-deploy-nginx-kubectl/` shipped
  with two manifests (Deployment + Service, separated for
  clarity), demo.sh covering deploy → port-forward → curl-
  validate → scale (rolling-update is prose-only), and a README
  documenting failure modes. UBI image pinned to
  `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/nginx-124` (UBI 9, nginx 1.24,
  runs as user 1001, listens on 8080 — rootless-friendly).
  §3 polish: new callout warns about the auto-detect trap that
  bit the r06 follow-up verification (docker-cli installed
  alongside podman can confuse minikube's driver auto-detect
  when only `rootless=true` is set). Reconciliation: six
  Section B rows promoted from r06 user run (§4 profile
  lifecycle, per-cluster resource override, §5 metrics-server /
  ingress / dashboard), five new §6 unverified rows added,
  Section C row for `examples/06-deploy-nginx-kubectl/` set to
  `in flight`

**Open, priority-ordered:**

1. Run `examples/06-deploy-nginx-kubectl/demo.sh` against the
   default minikube cluster. On `✓ SUCCESS`, five §6 Section B
   rows promote plus Section C
2. **r08** — §7 NodePort + `examples/07-nodeport-service/`.
   First example to expose a workload externally
3. **r09** — §8 PVs + `examples/08-persistent-volume/`
4. **r10** — §9 helm + authored small chart; helm-4-against-
   helm-3-chart compat claim from Section B promotes here
5. **r11** — §10 editor/shell/terminal; will request local-setup
   specifics
6. **r12** — §11 Istio (resource bump pre-flight; expect Section B
   resource claims to surface here)
7. **r13** — §12 KEDA (optional section)
8. **r14–r16** — tail sections, diagrams, editorial pass, final
   reconciliation refresh
